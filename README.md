## My process

### Features

- Responsive layout for **mobile â†’ desktop** (grid + flexbox)
- Utility classes for typography, spacing, and text colors
- Semantic, accessible HTML structure (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- Membership cards with pricing and CTA buttons
- Testimonials section with star ratings
- Call-to-action (CTA) with responsive background
- Hover and focus states for interactive elements
- Assets optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop (using `<picture>`)

### What I Learned

---

#### Accessibility

- Used semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for better structure.
- Implemented a `.visually-hidden` class for screen-reader-only text.
- Respected `prefers-reduced-motion` to improve accessibility for motion-sensitive users.

#### Modern CSS

- Leveraged **CSS custom properties** for colors, typography scales, and spacing.
- Built a **utility-first CSS approach** (`.flow`, `.container`, `.btn`, `.list--tick`) for consistency and reusability.
- Combined **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for responsive layouts.
- Used `background-clip: text` and gradients for modern text effects.

#### Component Styling

- Created reusable **card components** for membership tiers.
- Styled testimonials and CTA sections with consistent typography and layout utilities.
- Managed numbered lists with CSS counters.

#### Tooling

- Project scaffolded with **Vite** for fast builds and local dev server.
- Organized assets (`/public/images/`) and styles (`/src/style.css`) for scalability.
